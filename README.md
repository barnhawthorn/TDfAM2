# TDfAM2
Temporal Design for Additive Manufacturing, a program to enable variation in nozzle temperature or print speed in user specified regions of the build. Compatible with G-code sliced in Cura.

This repository contains an in-silico proof in principle Matlab code to support Temporal Design for Additive Manufacturing (TDfAM). The development of the code has been published in The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology
https://doi.org/... or in PDF format within this repository. 

Matlab and the associated license is required to run the programme. The software is licensed through an MIT license. 

The programme allows the user to apply TDfAM to any G-code file or pre-sliced geometry. It was developed and tested using G-code produced in UltiMaker's Cura 4.4
https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/. Whilst the code has been tested experimentally using an UltiMaker S5 and a Creality Ender 3 V2, please note the following text in the license file:
